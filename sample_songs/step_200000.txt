<prompt> <genre_pop> <angry> write a song about weekends <song>  astral in the shadow of a doubt i lay beneath the surface there is no return this journey begins and ends with shadows all around here my existence beckons to that place from which we come the future has been told as my confidence moves without hope at all but when you walk through darkness it's not your way he stands alone in their silent towers where trust and fear arise there is a purpose for this life to die from inside i am not deserving of this as time goes by, these eyes are on the rise they want me to speak their truth but silence can only cure those without knowing why why do my existence leave no room in sight? it has been years since now ever again i found nothing but there is hope for a brighter day and be left alone in this silent tower where trust and fear arise there is no return just needless to hear so all we have are thoughts of solitude so nothing's here, time to learn </song>
